# Dispatch Service Setup - RoboShop E-commerce App

The **Dispatch Service** is the third-party service in the RoboShop e-commerce application.  
It is responsible for **dispatching the product after purchase**. The service is written in **Go** and acts as a **consumer** from RabbitMQ where the **Payment Service** publishes the message.
